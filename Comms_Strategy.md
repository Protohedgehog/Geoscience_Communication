Geoscience Communications -- Communications Strategy
====================================================

**Executive Editors**: Sam Illingworth, Iain Stewart, Jon Tennant &
Kirsten v. Elverfeldt.

**Tagline from website**: Geoscience Communication (GC) is a journal to
help share knowledge and give more \"traditional\" recognition to
science communication in the geosciences. Science communication is used
as an umbrella term by GC to cover all aspects of outreach, public
engagement, widening participation, knowledge exchange, and any other
initiatives within the scope of the journal. It can be thought of as any
initiative which seeks to communicate an aspect of geoscience to a wider
audience than the experts within that particular field.

How to improve Altmetric scores
-------------------------------

-   Each article shared once on Facebook, with key snippet from Abstract
    or about importance of the article. Make sure to name all authors
    (Kirsten). During 'quiet periods', make sure to post once or twice a
    week either showcasing journal features, or doing a call for
    submissions.

-   Each Executive Editor (and relevant Editors) to tweet about the new
    article. Not just the title, but the importance of the study. Make
    sure to add Copernicus and EGU to each tweet.

    -   <https://twitter.com/EuroGeosciences>

-   Import each article into shared Zotero group (All).

    -   LINK

-   Directly contact relevant bloggers, news outlets, and individuals on
    Twitter with new articles as relevant (All). This mostly applies to
    articles flagged as 'media-worthy'.

    -   Curate a database of these contacts (All).

-   For each article, periodically check the Altmetric tracker to see
    where articles have been shared (JT).

-   Add articles to any relevant Wikipedia pages (All).

-   Share articles on the /science subreddit (JT).
